## 🎮 Game Concept

### Core Mechanics

HUMBUG! transforms traditional quiz games by introducing a **bluffing element**. Players take turns answering open-ended questions with multiple correct answers. The catch? You can bluff with a wrong answer, hoping others won't challenge you.

**When someone calls "HUMBUG!" on your answer:**

- ✅ **You were right** → The challenger loses a life
- ❌ **You were wrong** → You lose a life
- 🎯 **Successful challenge** → The challenger earns a "pass" token

The game continues until only one player remains "alive" - requiring both knowledge and psychological insight to win.

### What Makes HUMBUG! Unique

- **Knowledge + Psychology**: Success requires both trivia knowledge AND the ability to read opponents
- **Strategic Depth**: Decide when to bluff, when to challenge, and when to pass
- **Social Dynamics**: Creates memorable moments of tension, laughter, and surprise
- **Quick to Learn**: 5-minute rule explanation, yet endlessly replayable
- **No Equipment Needed**: Just this web app and your wits!

### Architecture

#### Unified Admin API (`/api/admin.ts`)

The admin panel uses a **single serverless function** to handle all operations, avoiding Vercel's 12-function limit:

```typescript
// Endpoint structure: /api/admin?resource={resource}&action={action}

Resources:
- users: User management (list, create, update, delete)
- questions: Question management (list, create, update, delete)
- answers: Answer management (list by question)
- packs: Question pack management (list, create, update, delete)
- activity: Activity log (list, filter, search)
- dashboard-stats: Dashboard statistics and analytics

Actions (REST-style):
- GET: List/retrieve resources
- POST: Create new resources
- PUT: Update existing resources
- DELETE: Remove resources
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Only 1 of 12 Vercel function slots used for admin
- ✅ Consistent error handling and logging
- ✅ Shared authentication middleware
- ✅ Unified activity logging system
- ✅ Easy to maintain and extend

#### Activity Logging System

All admin actions are automatically logged to `admin_activity_log` table:

```typescript
// Automatic logging on every admin action
await logActivity(
  admin.id,           // Who performed the action
  "UPDATE",           // What type of action (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE)
  "question",         // What entity was affected
  questionId,         // Which specific entity
  {
    changes: {...},   // What changed
    previous: {...}   // What it was before
  },
  req                 // Request context (IP, user agent)
);
```

**Logged data:**

- Admin user ID, name, email, picture
- Action type (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, LOGIN, LOGOUT)
- Entity type (user, question, pack, auth)
- Entity ID (specific record affected)
- Detailed changes (JSON)
- IP address and user agent
- Timestamp (automatic)

#### Database Schema

**Core Tables:**

- `users`: User accounts (id, name, email, picture, role, is_active)
- `questions`: Question bank (id, question_en, question_hu, category, difficulty)
- `answers`: Question answers (id, question_id, answer_en, answer_hu, is_correct)
- `question_sets`: Question packs (id, name, slug, type, access_level)
- `admin_activity_log`: Activity tracking (id, user_id, action_type, entity_type, details)

**Relationships:**

- Questions → Question Sets (many-to-one via set_id)
- Questions → Answers (one-to-many)
- Admin Activity → Users (many-to-one via user_id)

### UI/UX Design

#### Layout

## 🔐 Authentication & Environment Strategy

### OAuth Flow Architecture

This application uses **dynamic domain detection** for Google OAuth to ensure the authentication flow works correctly across all environments without manual configuration.

#### How It Works

Instead of relying on environment variables that may be misconfigured, the auth endpoints detect the current domain from HTTP request headers:

```typescript
// Dynamically detect the current domain from request headers
const host = req.headers.host || "localhost:5000";
const protocol = host.includes("localhost") ? "http" : "https";
const appUrl = `${protocol}://${host}`;
const redirectUri = `${appUrl}/api/auth/callback`;
```

This ensures:

- ✅ Production (`humbug.hu`) stays on production
- ✅ Pre-production (`humbug-quiz.vercel.app`) stays on pre-prod
- ✅ Local development (`localhost:5000`) stays local
- ✅ No environment variable configuration needed for domain detection

### Environment Configuration

#### Branch Strategy

| Branch   | Environment    | Domain                               | Purpose                |
| -------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| `master` | **Production** | https://humbug.hu                    | Live production site   |
| `main`   | **Pre-Prod**   | https://humbug-quiz.vercel.app       | Testing before release |
| Other    | **Preview**    | `https://[branch]-[hash].vercel.app` | Feature testing        |

#### Required Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file for local development:

```bash
# Database Configuration
POSTGRES_POSTGRES_URL="postgresql://user:password@host/database"

# Google OAuth Credentials
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-google-client-id"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-google-client-secret"

# JWT Secret (generate with: openssl rand -base64 32)
JWT_SECRET="your-secure-random-secret"

# Optional: App URL (auto-detected if not set)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:5000"
```

**For Vercel deployment**, set these environment variables in the Vercel dashboard for each environment. See [VERCEL_ENV_VARS.md](./VERCEL_ENV_VARS.md) for detailed setup instructions.

### Google OAuth Configuration

#### Required Redirect URIs

Add all three environments to your Google Cloud Console OAuth Client:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Select your OAuth 2.0 Client ID
3. Add these **Authorized redirect URIs**:

```
https://humbug.hu/api/auth/callback                    (Production)
https://humbug-quiz.vercel.app/api/auth/callback       (Pre-Production)
http://localhost:5000/api/auth/callback                (Local Development)
```

#### OAuth Endpoints

| Endpoint             | Purpose                            | Method |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------ |
| `/api/auth/google`   | Initiates OAuth flow               | GET    |
| `/api/auth/callback` | Handles OAuth callback from Google | GET    |
| `/api/auth/session`  | Validates current session          | GET    |
| `/api/auth/logout`   | Clears authentication cookie       | POST   |

#### Authentication Flow

1. **User clicks "Login with Google"**

   - Frontend calls `/api/auth/google`
   - Server detects domain from `req.headers.host`
   - Redirects to Google with correct `redirect_uri`

2. **Google redirects back to app**

   - Google calls `/api/auth/callback?code=...`
   - Server exchanges code for user info
   - Creates JWT token with user data
   - Stores user in database (if new)
   - Sets HTTP-only cookie with JWT
   - Redirects to app homepage

3. **Session validation**

   - Frontend calls `/api/auth/session` on mount
   - Server validates JWT from cookie
   - Returns `{ authenticated: true, user: {...} }`

4. **Logout**
   - Frontend calls `/api/auth/logout`
   - Server clears auth cookie
   - Redirects to homepage

### Local Development with OAuth

For local development, the project includes a custom Vite plugin (`apiRoutesPlugin` in `vite.config.ts`) that handles API routes during development:

```typescript
// vite.config.ts includes middleware for:
// - /api/auth/google: OAuth initiation
// - /api/auth/callback: OAuth callback handler
// - /api/auth/session: Session validation
// - /api/auth/logout: Logout handler
// - /api/question-sets: Question pack listing
// - /api/questions/:slug: Question pack data
```

**To run with OAuth locally:**

1. Ensure `.env.local` has all required variables
2. Add `http://localhost:5000/api/auth/callback` to Google OAuth redirect URIs
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. OAuth will work seamlessly with dynamic domain detection

### Security Features

- ✅ **HTTP-only cookies**: JWT token not accessible via JavaScript (XSS protection)
- ✅ **Secure flag**: Cookies only sent over HTTPS in production
- ✅ **SameSite=Lax**: CSRF protection
- ✅ **7-day expiration**: Automatic session timeout
- ✅ **Database persistence**: User data stored securely in Neon PostgreSQL
- ✅ **Dynamic domain detection**: Prevents redirect URI mismatches

### Troubleshooting OAuth

**Issue: "redirect_uri_mismatch" error**

- Verify all three redirect URIs are added to Google Console
- Check that the domain matches exactly (no trailing slashes)
- Ensure Google OAuth Client ID is correct in environment variables

**Issue: OAuth works locally but not in Vercel**

- Check Vercel environment variables are set correctly
- Verify `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` are present
- Ensure `JWT_SECRET` is configured in Vercel

**Issue: Session not persisting**

- Check browser allows cookies
- Verify cookie domain settings
- Check JWT_SECRET is consistent across deployments

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18.x or higher
- **npm** 9.x or higher (or yarn/pnpm)
- **PostgreSQL Database** (Neon recommended for serverless)
- **Google OAuth Client** (from Google Cloud Console)

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/szolzol/humbug-quiz.git
   cd humbug-quiz
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**

   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

   ```bash
   # Database (get from Neon dashboard)
   POSTGRES_POSTGRES_URL="postgresql://user:password@host/database?sslmode=require"

   # Google OAuth (get from Google Cloud Console)
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-google-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com"
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-google-client-secret"

   # JWT Secret (generate with: openssl rand -base64 32)
   JWT_SECRET="your-secure-random-secret-key"

   # App URL (optional, auto-detected)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:5000"
   ```

   See [.env.example](./.env.example) for a complete template.

4. **Set up Google OAuth**

   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
   - Create a new OAuth 2.0 Client ID (or use existing)
   - Add authorized redirect URI: `http://localhost:5000/api/auth/callback`
   - Copy Client ID and Client Secret to `.env.local`

5. **Initialize database** (optional - questions already in production DB)

   If setting up a new database instance:

   ```bash
   node database/migrate-two-packs.js
   ```

   This will create tables and populate with question packs.

6. **Start development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

7. **Open in browser**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:5000`
   - Or access from network: `http://[your-ip]:5000`
   - Test Google login to verify OAuth setup

## 💻 Development

### Available Scripts

| Command                 | Description                                    |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`           | Start Vite dev server (frontend only, no APIs) |
| `npm run dev:full`      | Start Vercel dev (frontend + API functions) ⭐ |
| `npm run dev -- --host` | Expose dev server on local network             |
| `npm run build`         | Build production bundle to `dist/`             |
| `npm run preview`       | Preview production build locally               |
| `npm run lint`          | Run ESLint for code quality checks             |
| `npm run type-check`    | Run TypeScript compiler checks                 |
| `npm run migrate`       | Run database migration scripts                 |

> ⚠️ **Important**: Use `npm run dev:full` when working with question packs, authentication, or any API features. The regular `npm run dev` only runs the Vite frontend server and will **not** load question packs.

### Development Workflow

1. **Create Feature Branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make Changes**

   - Edit files in `src/`
   - Hot reload will update browser automatically
   - Check console for TypeScript errors

3. **Test Responsiveness**

   - Mobile: Chrome DevTools (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + M)
   - Tablet: 768px - 1024px breakpoints
   - Desktop: 1024px+ layouts

4. **Build for Production**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

5. **Commit and Push**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Key Development Notes

- **Mobile Viewport**: Always test on actual mobile devices, not just emulators
- **Font Loading**: Fonts are self-hosted in `public/fonts/` for network compatibility
- **Audio Files**: Keep audio files under 5MB for fast loading
- **i18n**: Add translations to both `en.json` and `hu.json` when adding new text
- **Animations**: Use Framer Motion's `viewport={{ once: true }}` to prevent re-triggering on scroll

---

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Experience Qualities

1. **Dramatic** - Creates the tension and excitement of a high-stakes quiz show
2. **Sophisticated** - Appeals to adults who enjoy intellectual party games
3. **Engaging** - Interactive elements and animations keep visitors exploring

### Design Principles

- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between title (48px), headers (32px), and body (16px)
- **Color Psychology**:
  - Deep Navy = Authority and intelligence
  - Rich Gold = Success and achievement
  - Bright accents = Energy and excitement
- **Motion Design**: All animations serve a purpose - revealing, emphasizing, or guiding attention
- **Accessibility First**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant with 4.5:1+ contrast ratios
- **Mobile-First**: Start with mobile, progressively enhance for larger screens

### Color System (Triadic Harmony)

Using three equally spaced colors on the color wheel:

| Color       | Value                 | Purpose               | Contrast |
| ----------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | -------- |
| Deep Navy   | `oklch(0.15 0.1 240)` | Background, authority | Base     |
| Rich Gold   | `oklch(0.75 0.15 85)` | Highlights, success   | 12.8:1 ✓ |
| Bright Gold | `oklch(0.85 0.18 90)` | CTAs, focus           | 8.9:1 ✓  |
| White       | `oklch(0.98 0 0)`     | Text                  | 15.2:1 ✓ |

### Typography Scale

- **H1 (Game Title)**: Space Grotesk Black / 48px / -0.02em letter-spacing
- **H2 (Section Headers)**: Space Grotesk Bold / 32px / normal spacing
- **H3 (Card Titles)**: Space Grotesk SemiBold / 24px / normal spacing
- **Body Text**: Space Grotesk Regular / 16px / 1.6 line-height
- **Buttons**: Space Grotesk Medium / 18px / uppercase

---

## 🌍 Internationalization

### Supported Languages

- **Hungarian (hu)** 🇭🇺 - Primary language
- **English (en)** 🇬🇧 - Secondary language

### Adding New Translations

1. **Edit locale files**

   - `src/locales/hu.json` - Hungarian
   - `src/locales/en.json` - English

2. **Use in components**

   ```tsx
   import { useTranslation } from "react-i18next";

   function MyComponent() {
     const { t } = useTranslation();
     return <h1>{t("hero.title")}</h1>;
   }
   ```

3. **Access nested translations**
   ```tsx
   const questions = t("allQuestions", { returnObjects: true });
   ```

### Translation Structure

```json
{
  "hero": {
    "title": "HUMBUG!",
    "subtitle": "Tagline",
    "description": "Description text"
  },
  "rules": {
    "audioTitle": "How to play?",
    "section1": { "title": "...", "content": "..." }
  },
  "allQuestions": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "category": "travel",
      "question": "Question text?",
      "answers": ["Answer 1", "Answer 2"],
      "sourceName": "Wikipedia",
      "sourceUrl": "https://..."
    }
  ]
}
```

## � Question Pack Management

### Current Question Pack Structure

The application now features a reorganized question pack system with three distinct packs:

| Pack              | Slug            | Questions | Access Level  | Description                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | --------------- | --------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Free**          | `free`          | 4         | Public        | Free question pack available to visitor users - perfect for trying out the game              |
| **International** | `international` | 18        | Authenticated | Original "Humbug!" quiz questions including general knowledge and some US specific questions |
| **Hungarian**     | `hun-quiz-pack` | 6         | Authenticated | Hungary focused trivia covering the country with various topics                              |

**Total Questions**: 28 unique questions (down from 48 after duplicate removal)

### Pack Reorganization History

**October 2025**: Major database reorganization completed:

1. **Duplicate Removal**: Eliminated 20 duplicate questions (48 → 28 total)
2. **Pack Renaming**:
   - `us-starter-pack` → `international`
   - `hun-starter-pack` → `hun-quiz-pack`
3. **Terminology Update**: All "Starter Pack" / "Kezdőcsomag" → "Quiz Pack"
4. **Question Distribution**:
   - FREE pack: 4 exclusive questions (no overlap with premium packs)
   - HUN pack: 6 Hungarian-specific questions (identified by keyword search)
   - INT pack: 18 international/US questions (original US pack minus free questions)

### Database Scripts

Key database management scripts located in `database/`:

```bash
# View current pack descriptions
node database/show-pack-descriptions.js

# Update pack descriptions
node database/update-pack-descriptions.js

# Verify quiz pack renaming
node database/verify-quiz-rename.js

# Check for duplicate questions
node database/analyze-duplicates.js

# Reorganize question packs (already executed)
node database/reorganize-packs.js

# Clean up duplicate questions (already executed)
node database/execute-cleanup.js
```

### Pack Description Updates

Pack descriptions can be updated via database scripts. Current descriptions:

**FREE Pack**:

- EN: "Free question pack available to visitor users - perfect for trying out the game"
- HU: "Ingyenes kérdéscsomag látogatók számára - ideális a játék kipróbálásához"

**International Pack**:

## �🚀 Deployment

### Deployment Strategy

This project uses a **multi-environment deployment strategy** with Vercel:

| Environment    | Branch   | Domain                               | Purpose                |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| **Production** | `master` | https://humbug.hu                    | Live production site   |
| **Pre-Prod**   | `main`   | https://humbug-quiz.vercel.app       | Testing before release |
| **Preview**    | Other    | `https://[branch]-[hash].vercel.app` | Feature testing        |

### Vercel Deployment (Recommended)

This project is optimized for Vercel with automatic deployments:

#### Initial Setup

1. **Connect Repository**

   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Vercel auto-detects Vite configuration

2. **Configure Build Settings**

   - Framework Preset: **Vite**
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
   - Install Command: `npm install`

3. **Set Production Branch**

   In Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Git:

   - Production Branch: `master`
   - This ensures `master` deploys to custom domain (humbug.hu)
   - `main` branch deploys to `humbug-quiz.vercel.app` (pre-prod)

4. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Add these in Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables:

   **For ALL environments** (Production + Preview + Development):

   ```
   POSTGRES_POSTGRES_URL          (PostgreSQL connection string)
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID               (Google OAuth Client ID)
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET           (Google OAuth Secret)
   JWT_SECRET                     (Random secret for JWT signing)
   ```

   **Note**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` is **NOT required** - the app automatically detects the current domain from request headers.

   For detailed environment setup, see [VERCEL_ENV_VARS.md](./VERCEL_ENV_VARS.md).

5. **Configure Google OAuth Redirect URIs**

   Add all three environments to Google Cloud Console:

   ```
   https://humbug.hu/api/auth/callback
   https://humbug-quiz.vercel.app/api/auth/callback
   http://localhost:5000/api/auth/callback
   ```

6. **Deploy**
   - Push to `master` → Production deployment (humbug.hu)
   - Push to `main` → Pre-production deployment (humbug-quiz.vercel.app)
   - Push to other branches → Preview deployment

### Custom Domain Setup

To configure a custom domain with Vercel:

1. In Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Domains
2. Add your custom domain (e.g., `humbug.hu`)
3. Configure DNS records with your registrar:

   ```
   Type: A
   Name: @
   Value: 76.76.21.21

   Type: CNAME
   Name: www
   Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
   ```

- See [DOMAIN_SETUP.md](./DOMAIN_SETUP.md) for complete instructions
- Includes registrar-specific setup (Forpsi, GoDaddy, etc.)
- Troubleshooting and verification steps

### Custom Headers (vercel.json)

The project includes a `vercel.json` with:

- CORS headers for fonts
- Cache control for static assets
- Security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options)

### Manual Deployment

For non-Vercel hosting:

```bash
# Build production bundle
npm run build

# Test locally
npm run preview

# Deploy dist/ folder to your hosting provider
# Note: API routes require serverless function support
```

**Important**: The `/api` endpoints require serverless function support. If deploying to a static host, you'll need to set up a separate backend server for authentication and database access.
