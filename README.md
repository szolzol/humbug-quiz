## 🎮 Game Concept- [License](#-license)

### Core Mechanics# Build for productionNo problem! If you were just checking things out and don’t need to keep this code:

HUMBUG! transforms traditional quiz games by introducing a **bluffing element**. Players take turns answering open-ended questions with multiple correct answers. The catch? You can bluff with a wrong answer, hoping others won't challenge you. ---

**When someone calls "HUMBUG!" on your answer:**npm run build

- ✅ **You were right** → The challenger loses a life

- ❌ **You were wrong** → You lose a life## 🎯 Overview

- 🎯 **Successful challenge** → The challenger earns a "pass" token

`````- Simply delete your Spark.

The game continues until only one player remains "alive" - requiring both knowledge and psychological insight to win.

- **Code Splitting**: Automatic chunk optimization

- **Asset Optimization**: Images, fonts, and media compressed- **Node.js**: 18.x or higher

- **npm**: 9.x or higher (or yarn/pnpm)

---- **Git**: For cloning the repository

## 📜 Game Rules### Quick Start

### Complete Rule Set```bash

# Clone the repository

#### 1. **Preparation**git clone https://github.com/szolzol/humbug-quiz.git

HUMBUG! is a simple game that doesn't require any physical equipment, at most you need to keep track of lives and pass options. Only the game master needs to see the question "card", who reads the question aloud and verifies the answers.

# Navigate to project directory

#### 2. **Starting the Game**cd humbug-quiz

Each round begins with the game master asking a quiz question to the entire team, which usually has at least a dozen correct answers. The game master may only reveal the number of possible answers and the source of the question.

# Install dependencies

#### 3. **Players' Answers**npm install

Players must take turns giving one possible answer. Unless a player has a pass option, they must give an answer. If they don't know the answer, they can naturally bluff. The game master does not comment on the answers given.

# Start development server

#### 4. **The "Humbug!"**npm run dev

A round ends when a player challenges the answer of someone before them by loudly saying "Humbug!" The game master then checks whether the questioned answer is correct or not.````

#### 5. **Victory and Defeat**The application will be available at **http://localhost:5000**

- **Correct Answer Challenged**: Challenger loses a life

- **Incorrect Answer Challenged**: Answer-giver loses a life---

- **Successful Challenge**: Challenger earns a "pass" token (can skip one future turn)

- Players start with 1-3 lives (agreed upon before game)## 💻 Development

- The last player remaining wins

### Available Scripts

#### 6. **Alternative Game Mode**

With many players, the game can continue after the first challenge until a second "Humbug!" is called. In this case, 2 different players lose a life in that round.```bash

# Start development server with hot reload

---npm run dev
