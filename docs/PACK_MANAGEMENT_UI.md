- Server-side filtering (optimal)
- No pagination (not needed yet)
- Statistics calculated on-the-fly

### If Scale Increases

- Add server-side search
- Add pagination (20-50 per page)
- Cache statistics (update on changes)
- Add search indexing (full-text)

---

## Accessibility

### Keyboard Navigation

- Tab through filters
- Enter to submit forms
- Escape to close dialogs
- Arrow keys in dropdowns

### Screen Readers

- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels on icons
- Form field labels
- Status announcements

### Color Contrast

- All badges meet WCAG AA
- Text readable on backgrounds
- Focus indicators visible

---

## Browser Compatibility

### Tested/Supported

- Chrome/Edge (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Mobile browsers (iOS/Android)

### Known Issues

- None currently

---

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment

- [x] Database migration run
- [x] API endpoints tested
- [x] UI components tested
- [x] No TypeScript errors
- [x] No console errors
- [x] Activity logging verified
- [x] Authentication working
- [x] Authorization working

### Post-Deployment

- [ ] Verify migration in production
- [ ] Test pack creation in production
- [ ] Test pack editing in production
- [ ] Test pack deletion in production
- [ ] Verify activity logs in production
- [ ] Check performance with real data
- [ ] Monitor error logs

---

## Support & Maintenance

### Common Issues

**Q: Can't delete pack**
A: Pack has questions. Remove or reassign questions first.

**Q: Slug validation error**
A: Use only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. Use auto-generate.

**Q: Pack not visible to users**
A: Check both `is_active` and `is_published` are true.

**Q: Changes not saving**
A: Check browser console for errors. Verify admin session is active.

### Debug Steps

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API responses in Network tab
3. Check activity log for operation records
4. Verify database state directly
5. Check user's admin role/permissions
